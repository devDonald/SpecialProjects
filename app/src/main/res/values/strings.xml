    <string name="text_assignment">The God-Life Assembly has been called to raise a pure breed of believers, a kingdom minded people divergent in assignments, roles and functions according to the distribution of grace, but unified in destiny pressing onward daily to be conformed to the fullness of the image of the Christ, a generation who will weary the devil out.</string>
    <string name="love_text_body">Being recipients of God\'s Love, our reasonable and immediate response is to show forth God\'s power through love first to the Brotherhood, then to everyone we encounter </string>

        the heart of the Father aided by the Holy Spirit until we become just like him with no spot nor wrinkle</string>

    <string name="accountability_text_body">In accountability, we close in on our ranks because we are accountable first to GOD and then
        to one another. We build bridges of support and anchors of strength into one another’s lives; we stand through one another’s
        challenges and battles and we owe the body the responsibility to call one another to order in love and restore those from
        amongst us that may be overtaken in a fault, taking heed to ourselves knowing that we are products of grace.</string>
    <string name="worship_text_body">In worship, with bended kneels and open hearts we prostrate before the father, beholding the beauty of his holiness and channeling all the energies of our minds towards him in adoration </string>

    <string name="prayer_text_body">
        By Christ we offer up Spiritual Sacrifices in prayer, in and out of season, seeking to know the heart of the father and enforcing it on earth
